    <!-- Build an application that uses jQuery to do the following:

    1. Contains a form 
        with two inputs for a title and rating 
        along with a button to submit the form.

    2. When the form is submitted, 
        capture the values for each of the inputs and append them to the DOM 
        along with a button to remove each title and rating from the DOM.

    3. When the button to remove is clicked, remove each title and rating from the DOM.
    
    4. Ensure that the rating of a movie can only be between 0 and 10.
    
    5. Ensure that a title has at least 2 characters in it.
    
    6. Allow users to sort alphabetically by the title of the movie 
        or by the rating of the movie from lowest to highest and vice versa.
